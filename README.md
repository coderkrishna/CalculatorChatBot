### Requirements

We are members of a company - XYZ Software LLC and we are developing bots, messaging extensions, and cards for the Microsoft Teams platform. We are given a task that requires for us to build a chat bot that can conduct four basic arithmetic operations. To review they are:

1. Addition - returning the sum of the list of numbers

2. Subtraction - returning the difference in the list of numbers

3. Multiplication - returning the product when you multiply all of the numbers

4. Division - here we may have to implement some type of constraint saying that the number of inputs must be **two integers**
