                            <li>The list of numbers could either be in order, or be out of order. So, the bot would then make sure that the list that you provide is sorted in order</li>
                            <li>Once the numbers have been sorted in order, the bot will then find the middle element of the list. If the list is odd length, then the bot can find the median in a straight forward manner.
                            However, if the list is an even length, then the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements of the list.</li>
