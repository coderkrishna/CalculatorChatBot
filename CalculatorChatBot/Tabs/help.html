                        <p>Given the list of numbers that you provide, the bot will then calculate the average. First the sum of all numbers gets calculated. Then the bot will divide that sum by the size of the list</p>

                        <p>The bot will find the middle of the list in the following manner:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The list of numbers could either be in order, or be out of order. So, the bot would then make sure that the list that you provide is sorted in order</li>
                            <li>Once the numbers have been sorted in order, the bot will then find the middle element of the list. If the list is odd length, then the bot can find the median in a straight forward manner.
                            However, if the list is an even length, then the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements of the list.</li>

                        <b>Mode</b>
                        <p>Mode = Most. So the way that the bot will calculate the mode is taking the list of numbers that you provide it, sorting in either ascending or descending order, and then finding out which numbers appear the most number of times. There are three different 
                        possibilities here:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first being is that there is no mode at all, meaning that the mode = 0. This signifies that all values in this list are unique.</li>
                            <li>The second is that there is a mode, meaning that the mode = x. This signifies that there is one and only one value that has been repeated in the list.</li>
                            <li>The third being that the list is multi-modal - meaning that the mode would be a list of numbers x, y, z where x, y, and z are numbers that appear more than once in the original list that you have provided</li>
                        </ul>
